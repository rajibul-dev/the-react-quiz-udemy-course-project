# The React Quiz

## About the app

This is a project from [Jonas Schmedtmann's React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) I took. I didn't deploy this, but this is where I leanrt the useReducer hook.

## How to use (if you are curious)

1. Clone or download
1. Run `npm i`
1. `npm start` to start the live local server for the react app
1. `npm run server` to start the fake api

## I did add some of my features to it

- [x] Local storage to store the highscore
- [x] Nice CSS for the wrong answer

I know it's these two features are nothing hard to implement ðŸ˜…
